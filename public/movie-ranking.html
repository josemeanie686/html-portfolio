<h1>Some Pretty Good Movies</h1>
<h2>  According to Josephine</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>From the opening beat to the finale, it is beautiful, fun, and with personality.</p>

<h3>Lucky Number Slevin</h3>
<p>I like a good revenge story, and this one is just fun, with smart alecks, great actors, and lotsa style</p>

<h3>Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Too cool. I love what it says about us, how we fall into our own traps, and make the same mistakes. Maybe that's not so great, but maybe it's true. </p>
